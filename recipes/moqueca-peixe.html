    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Moqueca is a brazilian seafood stew that has strong african influence. It is
        easy and quick to prepare, which makes it perfect for a weeknight but special
        enough to serve to guests.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is tipically made with white fish, marinated with a simple mix of lime
        juice, salt and garlic. The base of the stew is made from tomatoes, bell peppers
        and garlic. Coconut milk will give the stew some flavour and creaminess.
        Also, it is important to include a bit of red palm oil, which will give it
        a vibrant orange colour and the unique flavour that distinguishes this
        moqueca from all other fish stews.

        <li>2 mid-sized onions, cut into circular slices</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers (one red, and one green), cut into circular slices</li>

        <li>4 ripe of tomatoes, chopped, optionally skinned</li>
        <li>4 cilantro stems with leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>
            12 tbsp of <i>Azeite de dendê</i> (a very tasty, heavy, red palm oil,
            which may not be ommited for moqueca)
        </li>
        <li>200ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Leave the fish in a marinade made out of lemon juice and fine powdered
            pepper for at least 1hr.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the fish, onions, bell peppers, garlic, tomatoes, and the cilantro in
            numerous layers into a pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the <i>azeite de dendê</i> and the coconut milk over all and let boil
            everything for 20min. From time to time, ladle/scoop the liquid from
            the pot's bottom to its top. Be careful, in order not to break the fish!
        </li>
        <li>
