    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna, or the italian lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly the oldest type,
        being mentioned firstly in 1282. It is made of very wide, flat sheets of pasta
        stacked in layers, alternating with fillings such as meat, vegetables, cheeses
        and spices.

        <li>680g ground beef</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>10-15 basil leaves, chopped or torn</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>225ml dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 pack of lasagna pasta sheets</li>
        <li>850ml béchamel sauce</li>
        <li>Finely-grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat until shimmering.
            Add in ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until all liquid
            had evaporated and meat begins to sizzle (10-15min).
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in wine, scraping the pot to loosen the fond. Simmer until wine has
            evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the crushed tomatoes, bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
            Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pre-heat the oven to 190°C.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into the ragu.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a thin layer of ragu in the base of the ovenproof dish and cover
            with a single layer of pasta sheets. Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over
            the pasta. Repeat this until you run out of meat, making sure that you
            have enough béchamel sauce left to cover the top layer of pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle grated parmesan over the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the dish in the oven on the top shelf and cook for about 45min, or
            until the top is lightly browned and the sauce is bubbling.
        </li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
    </ol>
